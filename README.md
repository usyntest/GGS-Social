# GGS Social

Social Media app for the students of [SGGSCC](https://www.sggscc.ac.in/) (my college)

This project is the successor of my failed Zuckerberg moment (a website similar to this app I created). It lacked a few features, the first and the biggest being a web app, mobile apps are easier to use.

## Technologies Used:

- Flutter
- Flask

## Running the Development Environment

Create the virtual environment and install dependencies

```shell
git clone https://github.com/usyntest/GGS-Social
cd GGS-Social
virutalenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app main run
```
